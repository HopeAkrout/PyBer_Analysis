# PyBer_Analysis
Analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
## Results
As rural areas tend to have a lower population and a longer distance to go between locations, it's unsurprising to see that urban areas far outstrips rural areas in all aspects.  In looking at the pie graph below, we can see that only 5.3% of rides were in rural areas, while 68.4% were in urban cities (see box and whisker plot further below for additional numbers):

With 66 urban cities and only 18 rural cities, PyBer is more widespread in urban areas to help with those numbers.  Interestingly, the number of drivers isn't comparable at only 2.6% in rural cities in comparison to the 80.9% (see Figure 7 below), showing correlation that rural drivers may have more work and therefore a possibly better ROI with staffing (see box and whisker plot further below for additional numbers).

As stated before, travel in rural areas tend to be longer distances, so though there are far fewer fares, they still bring in 6.8% in 2019, whereas urban cities only brought in 62.7% of the fares (see graph further below for an additional overview of how much higher fares are in rural areas):

However successful rural areas are for the limited population and drivers available, it's undeniable that the sheer number of people who take alternate forms of transportation in urban areas in contrast to rural areas can't be denied.  Urban areas have five times the number of fares, and although each ride is not as individually profitable, in large numbers it makes sense to provide services predominately in urban areas.  The below bubble chart below illustrates that outcome:

What looks like the best combination of larger fares with a substantial enough population to be provide service to is the suburban population.   You'll see in the Driver Count box and whisker plot above that the number of drivers is still fairly low (only 16.5% of the company's drivers), while having 30.5% of PyBer's fares.  Though it's undeniable that urban fares were more than double that of suburban fares in 2019, it's still a new enough market to the suburbs that there's potential for growth. 

## Summary
Without knowing population totals for each city type to compare the percent of the population that uses PyBer or ride-sharing companies in general, it's difficult to assess whether rural areas have reached their full potential.  It would be beneficial to add that information in and see if competitors are providing their services in similar areas and keeping an eye out for smaller towns that have had steady population growth and urbanization.

Suburban areas are profitable, but not necessarily consistent from one area to another like metropolitan cities tend to be.  While taking public transportation in one form or another is part of the city culture, the potential suburban clientele is more likely to own a vehicle and use ride-sharing only as an alternative.  I would recommend looking into areas where ride-sharing hasn't been fully established and public transportation isn't a great option.  As city planning is vastly different from location to location, there are a lot of areas where there are no subways or metros and the bus system is limited.  By establishing a base in locations like these, perhaps even as a mainly evening and late-night service when the buses stop running to establish trust and a good reputation in the community, the long term benefits could be substantial.

Urban areas will continue to be a mainstay in ride-sharing profits, though I would recommend looking further into the number of drivers vs. the number of rides being provided.  Do drivers have enough work, what is the lapse time between rides, etc. to better understand if the cities PyBer has drivers located are oversaturated and lower the number of drivers in the area for increased profitability.
